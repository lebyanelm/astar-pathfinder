# A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualiser
This is a path finder visualizer, with the start and end node,
it visualises the calculation of find the end node (Target node).

This *Pathfinding Algorithm* uses the A* Algorithm to find
the best shortest path possible. A* Algorithm looks around the
neighbor of every node to find the best shortest path then considers
as a possible path, with the help of the
[``Heuristic Fn``](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science))
for calculations of the path.
